Decorators are a fundamental concept in angular , allowing you to add metadata in your components.
Decorators are special kinds of functions that can modify or extend the behaviour of a class, method or property.
Angular uses different decorators for components, directives,pipes,services,modules etc..,

Eg: 
@component  extends a class with metadata like templateUrl,styleUrl,selector etc..,
@ngModule extends a function with metadata like provides,imports,bootstrap etc..,
similarly angular provides
@pipes -- for pipes
@Inject -- for services
@Injectable -- for services
@Directive -- for Directive
@Input -- to provide Input
@output -- to Provide output
@viewChild,@viewChildren -- to see child components Data
